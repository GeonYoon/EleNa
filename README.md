# EleNa Project

Explain about the project

## How to run the application locally

First, you need to have Docker installed in your desktop.
Run the following command in the project directory (where you have docker-compose.yml file).

```
docker-compose up
```
Once it finishes the building and runs the services, visit `localhost:3050`

## How to Update the Docker Images 

If you want to test the application once you make changes into the application, you need to force Docker to rebuild the image.
In this case, Run the following command.

```
docker-compose up --build
```
